The idea for the site to create a space that i can showcase my work, obtain offers for work and blog what I did, tutorials, documentation for tools that i create 


The stack of the website was a long run decision, from jeklyn and runned on githubpage to gatsby, and finally i had the decision to take the path of next js, you should be asking, but why ? 
Only one word changed me to use from gatsby to next, excalability, because in the future i wish that I offer courses for majority of people that like were self taught, and offer the peak of my vision regardles of what I wanted to create, so with gatsby you need to teak a lot of things, and If start with a wrong direction it will cost alot of effort to change it 

Add CSM interface with strapi/ netlify and offer it like 

Each day push some code
